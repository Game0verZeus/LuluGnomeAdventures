# Luluâ€™s Gnome Adventures

A small 8-bit style Python/Pygame game created in **half an evening**, because I wanted to explore my creativity and have fun!

In this retro adventure, you guide **Lulu**, a brave gnome capable of triple jumping and collecting a **magic hammer** to throw axes at mushrooms, birds, and even the fearsome BadLu.
